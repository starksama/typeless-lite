# Design System: Verba

## 1. Overview

**Creative North Star: "Quiet Instrument Panel"**

Verba should feel like a precise desktop utility that stays behind the user's writing flow. The interface is compact, neutral, and operational: one primary action, short state labels, dense controls, and no promotional framing.

Texture comes from disciplined material contrast, fine borders, steady state indicators, and the blue-to-mint identity used only where it communicates action or state. The tray icon is monochrome and icon-only; the app window may use brand color, but the macOS menu bar must remain native and quiet.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Compact desktop density with low-radius surfaces.
- Restrained light and graphite themes with tinted neutrals.
- Blue for primary actions and processing, mint for ready/recording/success.
- Status uses small dots and icon changes, not fake switches or text bars.
- Navigation selection uses one fixed 32px icon cell for hover, focus, and active states.
- Recording feedback is visible in two layers: a tiny non-text desktop indicator while active, and a compact in-app toast/status message when capture fails.

## 2. Colors

The palette is restrained: tinted neutral surfaces carry the app, and the blue/mint identity appears only on actions, focus, recording, copied states, and setup success.

### Primary
- **Signal Blue**: Primary buttons, focus borders, processing state, dirty API-key state, and selected settings controls.
- **Live Mint**: Ready, recording, success, copied feedback, and permission-enabled state.

### Neutral
- **Paper Canvas**: Light mode app canvas and content fields.
- **Soft Shell**: Light mode sidebar, chips, quiet buttons, and grouped controls.
- **Graphite Canvas**: Dark mode main canvas and panels.
- **Graphite Shell**: Dark mode sidebar, trays, and quiet controls.
- **Ink Text**: Main text in light mode.
- **Mist Text**: Main text in dark mode.

### Named Rules

**The Ten Percent Accent Rule.** Brand color must stay rare. If blue or mint dominates a screen, the interface is drifting into decorative AI-tool territory.

**The Native Tray Rule.** macOS tray assets are monochrome template icons. Do not use the colored app icon or a status text title in the menu bar.

## 3. Typography

**Display Font:** System sans stack.
**Body Font:** System sans stack.
**Label/Mono Font:** System sans stack. Do not use monospace for displayed shortcuts.

**Character:** Native, compact, and work-focused. The type should feel like a macOS utility, not a landing page or code editor.

### Hierarchy
- **Title** (560, 1.34rem, 1.14): Current workspace title only.
- **Section title** (550, 1.04rem, 1.2): Panel headings and compact feature titles.
- **Body** (400, 0.82rem, 1.58): Short helper text and transcript previews.
- **Label** (520, 0.72rem, 1.2): Field labels, section labels, and status metadata.
- **Key token** (540, 0.68-0.72rem): Shortcut display, always sans-serif.

### Named Rules

**The No Display Voice Rule.** Do not introduce display fonts, oversized headings, or fluid type. Verba is a compact tool.

## 4. Elevation

Verba is flat by default and layered by tone. Borders and subtle inset contrast define surfaces; shadows are reserved for the main native app frame, modals, and toasts.

### Shadow Vocabulary
- **Soft frame** (`0 18px 42px oklch(18% 0.014 262 / 0.11)` in light mode): Main canvas lift only.
- **Strong modal** (`0 28px 74px oklch(18% 0.014 262 / 0.18)` in light mode): Modal and elevated toast use only.
- **State glow** (`0 0 0 3px ... / 0.12`): Focus and small status dots, never a decorative halo.

### Named Rules

**The Flat-At-Rest Rule.** Controls, nav items, transcript rows, and settings panels must not float. Use borders and tonal changes before shadows.

## 5. Components

### Buttons
- **Shape:** Low-radius rectangle (5px), compact height (34px).
- **Primary:** Solid Signal Blue, used only for the current primary command.
- **Secondary / quiet:** Neutral surface or transparent background with border on hover.
- **Focus:** Blue focus ring with no layout shift.

### Status
- **Style:** Small square dot plus short label inside a compact pill.
- **Ready / recording:** Live Mint dot.
- **Processing:** Signal Blue dot.
- **Issue:** danger dot plus exact next action.
- **Tray:** Monochrome template icon, no text title. Recording changes the icon silhouette.
- **Desktop recording indicator:** Transparent, half-height dot line that responds to mic level. No text, border, or filled background. Processing uses only a small spinner.
- **No-speech feedback:** Keep a compact in-app error visible after recording ends and show a toast with the next action.

### Shortcuts
- **Style:** Sans-serif key tokens inside compact chips or shortcut controls.
- **Rule:** Show both Hold and Hands-free shortcuts inside the window bounds. Tokens may shrink or wrap before they overflow.

### Navigation
- **Sidebar:** Calm rows with a larger brand mark and a fixed 32px icon cell. Hover, focus, and active states must share the same icon-cell geometry; only color, border, and label weight change.
- **Settings rail:** Compact vertical tabs with a small leading state mark and low-radius active surface.

### Inputs / Fields
- **Style:** Dense label + bordered input on panel-deep background.
- **Focus:** Blue border plus subtle focus ring.
- **Secret values:** API keys show saved/missing state by default and reveal editing only on explicit user action.

### Toggle Controls
- **Style:** Small native-feeling track, 30px by 17px, with a 9px knob.
- **Checked:** Blue-tinted track and accent knob.
- **Container:** Quiet row with border only; no 3D button treatment.

### Transcript Rows
- **Style:** Timeline row with time, text, and one direct copy affordance.
- **Feedback:** Row-level copied state plus a subtle toast, no modal and no duplicate banners.

## 6. Do's and Don'ts

### Do:
- **Do** keep the primary workflow visible: speak, process, insert.
- **Do** use compact spacing, low radius, and short state labels.
- **Do** keep status indicators steady. Mic-level animation may move, but the whole status surface must not blink or re-render.
- **Do** make setup copy name the exact next action for macOS permissions.
- **Do** keep tray status icon-only and monochrome.
- **Do** keep shortcut tokens in the system font, never monospace.
- **Do** make microphone failures visible in-app; never collapse a failed dictation back to "Ready" without feedback.

### Don't:
- **Don't** build promotional SaaS dashboards.
- **Don't** use cute rounded controls, 3D button treatments, glass cards, purple gradients, or decorative texture.
- **Don't** use generic glowing microphone widgets.
- **Don't** add verbose setup tutorials or noisy diagnostics panels to default settings.
- **Don't** show vague errors that say something failed without naming the next action.
- **Don't** let header controls overflow outside the app window.
- **Don't** use a tray title such as Idle, Ready, Recording, or Processing.
